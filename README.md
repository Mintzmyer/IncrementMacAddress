# ChangeMacAddress
Bash script to increment OSX MAC address on active interfaces en0 and awdl0

The incrementMacAddress.sh file intends to update the user's MAC address. This can be useful for changing identity if a internet service provider allows complimentary access, but limits use tracked by the MAC address of the connection. 

By updating the address, the user can obtain a level of anonymity and mask repeated complimentary internet sessions.

Probably there are other uses. Soon, a complimentary file may be added to the repo that randomizes the MAC address.
